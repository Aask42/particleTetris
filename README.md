# particleTetris - PowerShell Edition

This is meant to be the repo for a PowerShell implementation of Tetris which will treat each termino as a set of 4x particles with different layers of the fabric of "spacetime" that interact and change as the arrow of time marches forward

## How to run

- Download Repository
- Navigate to the proj folder on the PowerShell cli

```powershell
.\init.ps1
```

- Note, ~~there is NO progression of time, and there are bugs on the line clear function~~
- Note: The progression of time has a curve to it, have fun and most importantly:
- Enjoy!
